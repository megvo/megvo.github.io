# Central Park Squirrel Portal

Three panels:
- **Sightings Game** (D3 mini-game) — `central-park-sightings.html`
- **Explorer** (behavior & interaction viz) — `explorer.html` (loads `squirrel_output.csv` from same folder)
- **Feed & Learn** (fur color story) — `assets/embeds/feed.html` (React placeholder; replace with your app)

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Drop all files/folders into your repo root (or a `docs/` folder if your Pages is set to `docs/`).
2. Ensure `explorer.html` and `squirrel_output.csv` live together (same folder level).
3. Push, then open `index.html` on Pages.

## Replace the Feed story later
- Replace `assets/embeds/feed.html` with your compiled React app output (or keep the placeholder).

Enjoy!
